# Liver Risk Assessment

This repository contains an R programming project for assessing liver risk using classification tree and random forest models. The project categorizes patients into the following categories based on their medical data:
- Cirrhosis
- Hepatitis
- Fibrosis
- Suspect Blood Donor
- Blood Donor

## Project Description

The Liver Risk Assessment project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and classification of liver conditions. Using a dataset of patient information, the project applies machine learning techniques to classify patients into different risk categories.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparative analysis of classification tree and random forest models
- Visualization of results

## Files

- `Liver_Risk_Assessment.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code.
- `Liver_Risk_Assessment_Report.pdf`: The PDF version of the R Markdown file, providing a detailed report of the analysis and results.
- `liver_risk_data.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis and model training.
- `model_performance_metrics.xlsx`: The Excel file containing the performance metrics for the classification tree and random forest models.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have R and the necessary packages installed.
